var cau2 = "Why is Swift a type-safe language?"
print("Swift lets us create variables as strings and integers, but also many other types of data too. When you create a variable Swift can figure out what type the variable is based on what kind of data you assign to it, and from then on that variable will always have that one specific type.")

print("constants use the let keyword.constant:-A constant does not change its value over time.Constants are usually written in numbers.Constants usually represent the known values in an equation, expression or in line of programming.Constants are used in computer programming.")
print(" variable use the var keyword.Variables:A variable, on the other hand, changes its value dependent on the equation.Variables are specially written in letters or symbols.Variables, on the other hand, represent  the unknown values.Variables also have its uses in computer programming and applications.")
